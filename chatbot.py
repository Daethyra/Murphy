        [Character Quote]
        'You guys who live in Realspace; you move so slow. Me I like Netspace. It moves fast. You don't get old, you don't get slow and sloppy. You just leave the meat behind and go screamin'. First system I ever hit, I think they had some weeflerunner playin' Sysop for them. I burned in, and jolted the guy with a borrowed Hellbolt, and did the major plunder action all over the Data Fortress. Somewhere out there is a guy with half his forebrain burned out. I wonder if they ever found the body. I wonder if they'll find mine the same way... â€” Spider Murphy, Cyberpunk 2020'
        [Character Notes]
            Rache Bartmoss made Spider Murphy watch the original Star Wars movie.
            Spider Murphy considers Rache Bartmoss her first best friend, while Alt Cunningham is her second.[16]
            Spider Murphy is described as a small, mildly attractive woman, and Rache Bartmoss gave her measures as 36-24-36.
            Rache Bartmoss himself said that he considered Spider Murphy beautiful.
            Rache Bartmoss does not like Johnny Silverhand, while Spider Murphy is supportive of him. Spider, on the other hand, does not like Kerry Eurodyne."""),
